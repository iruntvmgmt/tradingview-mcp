# Handoff: 2026-07-04c — CDP mouseMoved dialog opener fixed; checkbox write confirmed with persistence; all three settings field types verified

**Agent:** Sage (backend)
**Preceding handoff:** `docs/handoff/2026-07-04b-checkbox-blocked-compile-hardened.md`
**Branch / commit at session end:** `main` @ `6306a05`

## Correction of prior session's false conclusion

The 2026-07-04b session concluded that `div[data-name="indicator-properties-dialog"]` "doesn't exist in TV 3.2.0" and reverted settings_list_fields/read/write to verified:false. **This was wrong.** The dialog DOES exist (w=380) and opens via the gear icon. The prior session never called the real `DomSettingsBackend.list_fields()` method and instead reasoned from manual DOM inspection — the exact pattern this project has now corrected three times.

The dialog was always there. The problem was that **nothing in the codebase opened it** — `list_fields()` only reads from an already-open dialog. And earlier attempts to click the gear icon failed because CDP `mouseMoved` was never tried (only CGEventPostToPid and JS `.click()`, neither of which trigger CSS `:hover` on the renderer side).

## What changed

### Bug 1: Gear icon targeting (root cause of "wrong dialog" issue)
`_open_settings_dialog` used `parent.querySelector('[data-qa-id="legend-settings-action"]')` which returned the FIRST gear on the page — always SMA's, not the target indicator's. Fixed to use Y-distance-based matching: pick the gear closest in vertical position to the indicator title. Simple, robust, doesn't depend on DOM structure.

### Bug 2: Checkbox location (root cause of empty list_fields)
Checkboxes are nested inside the LABEL cell's `inner-RLntasnw` subtree, not in the value cell (next sibling) where number/dropdown fields live. Both `list_fields` and `write` methods only searched the value cell. Fixed to search the label cell as fallback.

### Bug 3: CDP mouseMoved needed for hover
CGEventPostToPid and JS `.click()` do NOT trigger CSS `:hover` in the renderer — only CDP's own `Input.dispatchMouseEvent` with `type: 'mouseMoved'` does. The gear icon has `opacity: 0` until hovered. CDP mouseMoved → gear becomes opacity:1 → CDP click works. This is documented in ADR-0008.

### Dialog-opening sequence (now in `_open_settings_dialog`)
1. CDP `mouseMoved` to indicator title + CDP click (selects the indicator)
2. CDP `mouseMoved` to indicator title (triggers CSS `:hover`, reveals gear)
3. CDP click on distance-matched gear icon
4. `indicator-properties-dialog` opens (w=380)

## What's verified true through real production methods

| Field type | Test | Method | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Checkbox | Basis False→True | `write()` then `list_fields()` | ✅ PASS (re-read) |
| Checkbox persistence | Close dialog, reopen | `list_fields()` after reopen | ✅ PASS (persisted) |
| Number | Length 21→26→21 | `write()` then `list_fields()` | ✅ PASS (no regression) |
| Dropdown | Source High→Low→High | `write()` then `list_fields()` | ✅ PASS (no regression) |

All three field types confirmed through the real `DomSettingsBackend.write()` and `.list_fields()` methods with explicit PASS/FAIL results.

## Known issues status

- `settings_write` checkbox entry: **fixed** — checkbox write/read/persistence confirmed
- `settings_list_fields`, `settings_read`, `settings_write`: **verified: true** — dialog opens programmatically, all field types detected
- The "stale dialog selector" false claim has been removed from recon_findings.json
